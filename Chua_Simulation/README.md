# Chua Simulation
Here you can find the first solution of the differential equation that rules the Chua's Circuit and the second attempt of the solution of the equasion keeping in mind of the Gyrator used to simulte the Inductance. As always you can find all the graphs generated by the programs.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

As or the data collection, to run the graph generating script:
```bash
 	gnuplot <script_name>.gp
```

To compile and run the c++ programs you will just need to:
```bash
	./compile.sh
```
