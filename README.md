# Development of an electronic chaotic circuit on the "RemoteLab" platform
Hi! This repository contain all the work I did for my Bachelor thesis in Physics @ the University of Trento.

Here you can find: 
 - all my data collected using the ["RemoteLab" platform](https://github.com/LeonardoRicci/RemoteLab),
 - the simulation, using [Runge-Kutta 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods), of the circuit theoric behaviour,
 - the images of the "RemoteLab", the circuit and the schematics.
