# Data Collection
Here you can find the first and second run of data I've collected during the thesis work.

&nbsp;

Each master folder contains: 
 - one folder with all the data files,
 - one folder with gifs of the circuit behaviour,
 - one folder with all the graphs generated from the data files. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

To run the graph generating script:
```bash
 	gnuplot <script_name>.gp
```

&nbsp;

To compile and run the c++ programs you will just need to:
```bash
	./compile.sh
```
